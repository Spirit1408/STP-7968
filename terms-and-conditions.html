                The Application stores and processes personal data that you have
                provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the
                Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of
                your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider
                strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone,
                which involves removing software restrictions and limitations
                imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such
                actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious
                programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may
                result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.
                Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services
                that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to

                Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume
                responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the
                Application require an active internet connection, which can be
                Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service
                Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not
                function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if
                you have exhausted your data allowance.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="policies-block">
              <p class="policies-text">
                If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please
                be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms
                still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your
                mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the
                application, or other third-party charges. By using the
                application, you accept responsibility for any such charges,
                including roaming data charges if you use the application
                outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without
                disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
                device on which you are using the application, they assume that
                you have obtained permission from the bill payer.

            <div class="policies-block">
              <p class="policies-text">
                Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume
                responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance,
                it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains
                charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable
                to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held
                responsible.

                In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use
                of the application, it is important to note that while they
                strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times,
                they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so
                that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider
                accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you
                experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality
                of the application.

            <div class="policies-block">

                The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some
                point. The application is currently available as per the
                requirements for the operating system (and for any additional
                systems they decide to extend the availability of the
                application to) may change, and you will need to download the
                updates if you want to continue using the application. The
                Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update
                the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible
                with the particular operating system version installed on your
                device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the
                application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also
                wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its
                use at any time without providing termination notice to you.
                Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
                you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete
                it from your device.
